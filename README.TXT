USER INSTRUCTIONS:

This project will simulate an amusement park to determine the ideal combination of rides
and visitors. It will read a configuration file which determines the rides in that park with specific characteristics to it. Each characteristics of these rides will establish its precise limitations to certain age groups, average wait time, space for the ride, and more. Some of the assumptions made for this project includes that regardless of the group's set age, they will equally desire any of the available rides decided by the random Class. The final goal for this project is to see the statistics of the amusement park after a number of fixed time steps. These results should not only give the statistics of each rides but should allow the user to find the ideal configuration of an amusement.
